## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This is the capstone challenge project of the Udacity DSND program. I had so many options but I chose to work on the problem of predicting house prices using Advanced Regression techniques. The information about the datasets and the problem can be found in this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data).


My goal is in this projects is to predict the final price of the homes and store the predictions in a file::

To achieve the result I did the following steps and you can also read the write-up for the project where I explain all the steps to build the model which consists of skills such as:

1. Data exploration and visualization
2. Data Analysis (Univariate, Bivariate and analysis on categorical & continous features)
3. Data preprocessing
4. Modelling and Hyper tuning
5. Final step: Creating dataset with predicted values(Output/Goal)


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

Datasets folder contains:

1. train.csv - the training set
2. test.csv - the test set
3. data_description.txt - full description of each column
4. sample_submission.csv - how our output file should look like
 

The notebook file Advanced Regression.ipynb available here showcsae all my work related to the achieve the results.

In the Write-up.pdf file I explain all the steps to build the model with details and statistical data and with some visualizations from the notebook

Output folder contains:
Final output of the model named as predict_csv.csv



## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the model can be found on the notebook Advanced Regression.ipynb and write-up.pdf and the final output in predict_csv.csv in the Output directory



## Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Kudos to Udacity courses for some of code ideas, and to kagglers for so many ideas and data.

##NOTE:
Before exploring the model it is adviced to go through the Write-up.pdf and the data_description.txt file in the Datasets directory
